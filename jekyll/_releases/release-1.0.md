**Validation** - !Include and Fixture class Validation

**Global Key Bindings** - Key bindings are now globally scoped within the whole workspace.  Previously Open FitNesse (Ctrl+Shift+Z) only used to work once you were in the editor.

**Menu Changes** - The Global FitNesse menu has now gone.

**FitNesseRoot Configuration** - The FitNesseRoot directory can now be configured in the preference page.

**Maven/Tycho** - The build has now been converted to a maven/tycho, allowing the plugin to be built more easily by our build server.
